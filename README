Note that the 2N5172 transistor wire sequence is ECB. Other transistors will work, check the datasheet for the following specifications:

* Emitter-Base Voltage (VEBO) of at least 5V
* Collector Current - Continuous (IC) of at least 400mA
* Minimum DC Current Gain (hFE(min)) of 100

To use a single IR LED, change the 10R resistor to 18R.
To use three IR LEDs instead of two, change the 10R resistor to 1.8R. Connect all three IR LEDs in series.
